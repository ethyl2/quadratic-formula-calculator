# Quadratic Equation Roots Calculator

## The challenge was to build a quadratic equation root calculator with custom validation handling.

### Deployed site:

https://ethyl2.github.io/quadratic-formula-calculator/index.html

### Spec:

- Display a red border around inputs with invalid values.
- When a user submits the form and any of the inputs have invalid values, an alert is displayed, containing a message for each input with invalid values.

Normally, I would add attributes to input elements to aid with validation, such as required, min and max, but in this case, they had to be omitted to allow for the custom submission handling.

## Additional features:

- Additional styling
- Clear button
- Canvas element to visualize quadratic equation. Not fully polished yet.
